blog about the conditional choices you just implemented

blog about map, filter, reduce

Add the following modification and blog about it:
game = create_game()

while(!game['done']):
    game = play_game(game)
    
rename saved_data to player_data

make no destructive updates player_data = some_func(player_data)

(use maps instead of for loops to build prompts?)
explain that now the only place where data gets mutated is in the while loop and why that's good.

Maybe have a display state sub-dict an a render function?

Can I do model-view-update?

quitting should go to a quit scene, or maybe there should just be a quit function that the game data invokes?
